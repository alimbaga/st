# ST

st is a simple terminal implementation for X. This repository is not exactly a
fork of st, but rather a build setup. The goal is to have a sane way
of keeping track patches while making it easy to update to latest version of
st.

To build and install run the following:

```
make patch          # to apply patches
sudo make install   # to build and install
```
